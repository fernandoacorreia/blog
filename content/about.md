I've been a software engineer for over 30 years, working mostly on enterprise software.

Currently I'm a Principal Software Engineer at [Domino Data Lab](https://www.dominodatalab.com/), where we're building a [leading data science platform](https://www.dominodatalab.com/resources/gartner-magic-quadrant-data-science-platforms/).

We're [hiring](https://grnh.se/407a3e121us)!
