This is part 1 of my [journey](/categories/learning-golang/) learning Golang.

The Go programming language (Golang) is becoming more relevant by the day. It is, famously, the language of the Docker
and Kubernetes projects. Both have had a huge impact on how companies run applications, and I develop for them on a
daily basis. Golang is also seeing increased adotoption at my company.

I'm starting on a journey to become more familiar with this language. I decided to start from the fundamentals. I'm
going to follow the [Learn Go](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-go) course on Codecademy

I'm going to share notes of what I learn as I go.

Have you thought about learning Go too? Or have you already learned it? What other resources would you recommend for a
novice? Let me know in the comments below.
