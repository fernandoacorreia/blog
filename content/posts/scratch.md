# Arithmetic

We can perform arithmetic in Go with literals (or named values, covered in the next exercise) using the following operators:

- `+` to add
- `-` to subtract
- `*` to multiply
- `/` to divide
- `%` to take the remainder (the modulus operator) between two numbers.

# Scope (identifiers, variables)
