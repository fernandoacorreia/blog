I decided to start a new blog to talk about software development.

It's been about 5 years since I last had a blog, so I went looking for what people are using in 2020.

It turns out that [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) is quite popular for building static sites.

Two of its selling points are that it is super fast, and that people have built hundreds of good-looking
[themes](https://themes.gohugo.io/) so that you can hit the ground running.

I'm keeping the blog [sources](https://github.com/fernandoacorreia/blog) on GitHub, and I'm hosting it on [GitHub Pages](https://fernandocorreia.dev).

It took me a couple hours to set everyting up (including domain name, DNS and SSL certificate).

Hugo's [Get Started](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/) documentation is super helpful.

This was very low-friction and makes me ever more excited to get back to writing!
